<p class="one">Prayaas corps is an NGO with a motto to stir and inspire the youthâ€™s mind in schools and colleges for national consciousness and work for the cause of society, this independent student organization was formed in 2013 on the day of 12th January. On the birthday of Swami Vivekananda, Prayaas-India, as it was initially called, comprised of a few students from Amity University Jaipur, Rajasthan.
